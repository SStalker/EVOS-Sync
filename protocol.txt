The User needs to send a message to the server, which contains the session id,
id of user id and the quiz id. The sync server checks if the user is the
quiz's owner and that the quiz is active. The session will be saved in the
session list. The Server will inform the User on success. All messages contain
a field "type" which identifies the message.

// A user starts a new quiz and registers it on the sync server.
User -> Server
{
	type: 'start',
	session_id: <SessionID>,
	user_id: <UserID>,
	quiz_id: <QuizID>
}

// After successfully registering a new quiz, the server informs the user.
Server -> User
{
	type: 'accept'
}

// Attendee logs on a quiz.
Attendee -> Server
{
	type: 'logon',
	session_id: <SessionID>,
	quiz_id: <QuizID>
}

// Server informs the attendee that he is logged on.
Server -> Attendee
{
	type: 'accept'
}

// User starts a quiz or switches to the next question
User -> Server
{
	type: 'next',
	session_id: <SessionID>
}

Server -> Attendee
{
	type: 'next'
}
